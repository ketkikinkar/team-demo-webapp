# Deployment Instructions

**The Dashboard is located in: `team-manager/index.html`**

(It accidentally ended up in a sub-folder during the build, but it is safe to use).

1.  **Open the File**
    *   Go to your `Downloads/team-manager` folder.
    *   Open the folder named `team-manager` inside it.
    *   Open the `index.html` file found **inside that sub-folder**.
    *   *Verification: You should see "Executive Overview" in the code.*

2.  **Copy & Deploy**
    *   Select All (Cmd+A) and Copy (Cmd+C).
    *   Go to **Apps Script** > `Index.html`.
    *   **Delete everything** and **Paste**.
    *   **Deploy**.

3.  **Find the Dashboard**
    *   Open the Web App.
    *   Click **"Overview"** in the sidebar.
